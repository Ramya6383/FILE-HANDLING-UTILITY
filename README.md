## The Java File Handling Utility is a console-based application developed to demonstrate the core concepts of file input and output (I/O) operations in Java. It enables users to perform essential file management tasks such as reading from, writing to, and appending data to text files. This utility serves as a fundamental building block for understanding how Java interacts with the file system, making it a crucial learning project for beginners and an efficient tool for lightweight file-based operations. The project is fully interactive and uses standard Java libraries for file handling, offering a user-friendly interface via the command line. Users can enter content that will be written to a file, view existing content, or append new data. It can be enhanced to support multiple file formats or integrated into larger systems requiring local data storage and manipulation.
